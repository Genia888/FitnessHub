## 1. Execute Development Tasks

**Purpose:** To implement features and deliverables according to the sprint plan.

### Version Control Strategy

**Git Workflow:**
- **Main Branch:** Production-ready code (`main`)
- **Feature Branches:** Individual developer branches (`evgeni`, `sebastien`, `elhadj`)
- **Merge Process:**
  1. Developer completes feature on their branch
  2. Test locally to ensure functionality
  3. Merge to `main` branch
  4. Notify team members via Discord
  5. Team members pull latest changes from `main`

**Branching Strategy:**
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# Work on feature, commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Implement user login functionality"

# Push to remote
git push origin feature/user-authentication

# Merge to main (after testing)
git checkout main
git merge feature/user-authentication
git push origin main

# Notify team to pull
# Team members: git pull origin main
```

Test 2: Invalid email
  - Input: {"email": "invalid@example.com", "password": "Password123"}
  - Expected: 401 Unauthorized
  
Test 3: Invalid password
  - Input: {"email": "Seb@gmail.com", "password": "WrongPassword"}
  - Expected: 401 Unauthorized
  
Test 4: Missing fields
  - Input: {"email": "Seb@gmail.com"}
  - Expected: 400 Bad Request
```

**Postman Collection:**
- Create collection for all API endpoints
- Include authentication headers
- Test success and error scenarios
- Export collection for team sharing

#### Frontend Testing
**Manual Testing:**
- Form validation (required fields, email format, password strength)

- Error message display
- Navigation flow
- Responsive design (Chrome DevTools device emulation)

### Development Workflow Example

**Feature: User Authentication**

**Step 1: Backend (Sebastien)**
```python
# app/api/v1/auth.py
@auth_bp.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    data = request.get_json()
    email = data.get('email')
    password = data.get('password')
    
    user = User.query.filter_by(email=email).first()
    if user and user.check_password(password):
        token = generate_token(user.id)
        return jsonify({
            'token': token,
            'user': user.to_dict()
        }), 200
    
    return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid credentials'}), 401
```

**Step 2: Frontend (Elhadj)**
```javascript
// scripts/login.js
document.getElementById('loginForm').addEventListener('submit', async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    
    const email = document.getElementById('email').value;
    const password = document.getElementById('password').value;
    
    try {
        const response = await apiService.post('/api/v1/auth/login', {
            email,
            password
        });
        
        authManager.setToken(response.token);
        window.location.href = '/pages/user_account.html';
    } catch (error) {
        showError('Login failed. Please check your credentials.');
    }
});
```

**Step 3: QA Testing**

### Metrics Tracking

#### 1. Sprint Velocity
**Definition:** Number of tasks/story points completed per sprint

**Calculation:**
```
Sprint 1 Velocity = Total Completed Tasks / Sprint Duration
Example: 15 tasks / 2 weeks = 7.5 tasks per week
```

**Velocity Tracking:**
| Sprint | Planned Tasks | Completed | Velocity | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Sprint 1 | 12 | 10 | 83% | Auth took longer than expected |
| Sprint 2 | 15 | 14 | 93% | Good progress, 1 task deferred |
| Sprint 3 | 14 | 15 | 107% | Ahead of schedule |
| Sprint 4 | 16 | 15 | 94% | Final polish needed |

#### 2. Task Completion Rate
**Formula:** (Completed Tasks / Planned Tasks) × 100%

**Weekly Tracking:**
| Week | Planned | Completed | Rate | Status |
|------|---------|-----------|------|--------|
| Week 1 | 8 | 7 | 87.5% | ✅ Good |
| Week 2 | 10 | 10 | 100% | ✅ Excellent |
| Week 3 | 12 | 9 | 75% | ⚠️ Behind schedule |
| Week 4 | 10 | 11 | 110% | ✅ Ahead |

#### 3. Bug Tracking
**Categories:**
- **Critical:** Blocks functionality, must fix immediately
- **High:** Major issue, fix before sprint end
- **Medium:** Minor issue, fix if time permits
- **Low:** Cosmetic, backlog for future

**Bug Metrics:**
| Week | New Bugs | Fixed Bugs | Open Bugs | Critical |
|------|----------|------------|-----------|----------|
| Week 1 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
| Week 2 | 5 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| Week 3 | 7 | 8 | 1 | 0 |
| Week 4 | 4 | 5 | 0 | 0 |

**Bug Resolution Rate:** (Fixed Bugs / Total Bugs) × 100%

### Code Review

1. Push to branch
2. Team review on Discord
3. Approval → Merge
4. QA testing

---
# Phase 1 – Front-End Structure & Static Pages

Created main HTML pages

Built the base layout with header, navigation menu, and containers for each section.

Added global styles through main.css and organized assets (images, icons).

Structured the project folder properly:
pages/, scripts/, styles/, and public/images/ready.

# Phase 2 – API Integration & Dynamic Rendering

Connected the Front-End with the Back-End API using fetch() calls.

Created shop.js → fetches products from http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/product_shop and displays them dynamically.

Created coach.js → fetches coaches from the backend (/api/v1/user/coach) and renders coach cards.

Replaced static HTML with dynamic generation using JavaScript.

Added debugging logs in the console to verify data flow.

# Phase 3 – Cookie, Token & Session Management

Built a dedicated cookie.js file with modules:

CookieManager → handles saving, retrieving, and deleting tokens.

UserSession → stores and retrieves user profile data.

CartManager & SubscriptionManager → for cart and subscription state.

Linked cookie.js to key pages (shop, coaches, subscriptions, etc.).

Implemented persistent session logic using cookies and localStorage.

Created connexion.js → manages login form submission, sends POST request to the backend,
receives { token, user }, stores both, and redirects based on role (coach or user).

Updated login.js → same pattern, but for user/coach registration with token storage.

# Phase 4 – UI & Visual Adjustments

Refined the look of dynamically loaded content: product and coach cards.

Improved grid layout consistency, padding, and spacing.

Adjusted image sizes (larger visuals for products).

Re-aligned button colors to match FitnessHub’s visual identity.

Verified responsive design and maintained previous style after connecting the backend.

Ensured UI stayed modern and cohesive even after adding dynamic rendering.

# Phase 5 – Authentication Flow Testing & Backend Validation

Linked login.html and connexion.html with backend endpoints.

Confirmed that user and coach registration/connection correctly POST requests to the API.

Verified token creation and cookie storage in the browser.

Tested integration with Swagger to confirm new users/coaches are saved in the backend.

Began debugging and verifying role-based redirections (user_account.html, coach_account.html).

# FitnessHub Backend Work by Sebastien

# Phase A – API & Database Design

Defined the data models (User, Coach, Product, Subscription) with appropriate fields: first_name, last_name, picture, coach_experience, etc.

Created database schema / migrations (tables, relations) pour gérer coaches, users, produits, abonnements.

# Phase B – API Endpoints Implementation

Built register endpoint (POST /api/v1/register) to create users or coaches.

Built login/authentication endpoint to validate credentials, generate tokens, return user data.

Built product endpoints: e.g. GET /api/v1/product_shop to retrieve product list.

Built coach endpoints: e.g. GET /api/v1/user/coach to retrieve coach data.

Possibly endpoints to manage subscriptions, user profile, etc.

# Phase C – Security & Token Handling

Integrated JWT (token-based authentication) or token mechanism for secure access.

Middleware / guards to ensure protected routes require valid token.

Hashing passwords (ex: bcrypt) and storing securely in database.

# Phase D – Swagger / API Documentation

Set up Swagger (OpenAPI) documentation, exposing the API schema, endpoints, models, and responses.

Ensured endpoints, request bodies, response payloads match front-end expectations (fields, naming).

# Phase E – Testing & Integration

Tested endpoints via Postman / Swagger to ensure data operations work (CRUD).

Validated correct JSON output, correct status codes, error handling.

Debugged mismatches with front-end: aligning JSON keys with front-end usage.


- We have a main branch on git hub and one branch for each member
- When a task seems good we merge on the main and call other member to pull the modification

# 2. Monitor Progress and Adjust
# Daily Stand-Ups

Every day, we hold a short 5–15 minute meeting on Discord to review our progress.
Each team member explains:

What they did yesterday

What they plan to do today

If they are facing any blockers

This allows us to identify problems early and help each other when something is stuck.
For example:

Evgeni (Front-End) shares updates about connecting pages like coach.html or shop.html with the backend.

Sébastien (Back-End) explains the API progress or fixes issues with authentication routes or database connections.

# Project Management Tools

We use Trello and a shared whiteboard to organize our tasks and follow the Agile method.
Each card in Trello represents a task, with three columns:

To Do – tasks planned for the current sprint

In Progress – what’s currently being developed

Done – completed tasks

We regularly update task statuses to visualize overall progress.
This method helps us track:

Sprint velocity (tasks completed per sprint)

Percentage of tasks completed vs. planned

Number of bugs or integration issues fixed each week

# Adjust When Needed

We frequently adjust sprint goals and task ownership depending on progress:

If one member finishes early, they anticipate the next task or help another teammate.
For example, when one front-end developer finished building static pages, he started connecting them to the backend API.

If the backend was delayed, the front-end team worked on static mock pages and prepared API integrations in advance.

Tasks were reassigned when necessary to balance workload and maintain steady progress.

# Metrics and Tracking

During each sprint, we monitored a few key indicators:

Sprint velocity: average number of tasks completed per week

Task completion rate: proportion of completed tasks vs. planned ones


# 3. Conduct Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives

We worked with four weeks of sprints. At the end of each sprint, our team of three met to talk about the progress and test the new features.
We didn’t do real sprint reviews, but we tested all the new pages and backend features directly on our own branches before pushing to the main branch. This helped us make sure everything was working correctly before integration.

During our retrospectives, we talked about what went well and what we could do better.
We noticed that our communication improved a lot during the project. We also got better with the backend, especially with connecting the API to the frontend. Finally, we improved our debugging skills — we learned how to find and fix bugs faster.

For the next sprints, we planned to keep this same workflow, but with better time management and clearer task organization.


# 4. Final Integration and QA Testing

At the end of the development, we started the final integration and QA testing to make sure every part of the project worked together.
We tested all the main features like login, registration, the shop, and the coach list. We are still testing now because we continue to find some bugs.

We did only manual testing. We added data directly in Swagger and checked if it appeared correctly on the website. We also used a small Python script to automate the creation of data such as clients, coaches, nutrition plans, and workout plans, to see if they were displayed properly on the front-end.

During this phase, we found and fixed an important bug where the plan chosen by a user was not added to the cart. We also corrected some display issues. Everyone in the team worked on the major bugs, and the smaller ones were fixed by the person who discovered them, after sharing them with the team to improve communication.
