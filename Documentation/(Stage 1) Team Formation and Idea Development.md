# 1. Research and Brainstorming
## Individual and Group Research

Each team member conducted initial research to identify potential project opportunities. We explored :
- Real-world problems such as lack of affordable access to fitness and nutrition guidance.
- Industry trends like the growth of digital health, fitness apps, and remote coaching platforms.
- Innovative solutions in mobile technology, wearable integration, and AI-driven personalization.

This research highlighted the increasing demand for accessible, personalized health and fitness solutions, inspiring us to generate ideas around digital platforms for wellness.

## Brainstorming Session
We created a mind map centered on the theme health and fitness solution.

# 2. Idea Evaluation
- Create a website/mobile to communicate between coach and users
- The user can choose a coach from sport and diet
- The user can see on his app the training menu and diet menu of the day
- Fitness Hub can sell goodies to user
- The user pay an abonnement to get the training of the coach

# 3. Decision and Refinement  

## Selected MVP  
**FitnessHub – Platform connecting fitness coaches and clients**  

## Main Objective  
Develop an intuitive web platform that connects fitness coaches, nutritionists, and dietitians with users seeking personalized guidance (fitness programs + nutrition) accessible from anywhere.  

## MVP Description  
For the MVP, we aim to build a simplified version of the platform that includes:  
- A client area to create a profile, set goals (weight loss, performance, wellness, etc.), and track progress.  
- A coach area with detailed profiles (experience, specialization, photos) and the ability to provide personalized programs.  
- A basic communication system (real-time chat or integrated messaging).  
- A simple progress tracking module (basic statistics: calories, completed sessions, progression).  

## Problem It Solves  
- Difficulty finding the right coach (fitness/nutrition) in a simple, centralized way.  
- Lack of accessible tools to clearly track progress.  
- Limited personalization in existing online programs.  

## Target Users  
**Clients:**  
- Individuals looking to lose weight or improve their health.  
- Amateur athletes seeking structured support.  
- Users looking for simple, easy-to-use solutions.  

**Coaches:**  
- Certified fitness trainers.  
- Nutritionists and dietitians.  
- Specialized coaches (yoga, CrossFit, bodybuilding, etc.).  

## Key Features (MVP)  
- Profile creation (clients and coaches).  
- Personalized programs based on goals.  
- Direct messaging (chat or integrated system).  
- Progress tracking (calories, sessions, weight, objectives).  
- Simple and responsive interface.  

## Expected Outcomes  
- Allow users to quickly find the right coach for their needs.  
- Provide coaches with a platform to grow their client base.  
- Build an initial community around fitness and nutrition.  
- Validate the relevance of the approach before adding advanced features (wearable integration, gamification, e-commerce).
